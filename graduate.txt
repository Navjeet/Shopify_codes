I am humble and pleased to announce that I have completed my Bachelor degree from FAST National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences Lahore campus.It was a pretty enjoyable journey.

It was ABSOLUTELY NOT POSSIBLE without my parents prayers, encouragement and support throughout my stay as FAST NUCES Lahore. I am also thankful to Allah who blessed me with the teachers, who were kind and supportive.
